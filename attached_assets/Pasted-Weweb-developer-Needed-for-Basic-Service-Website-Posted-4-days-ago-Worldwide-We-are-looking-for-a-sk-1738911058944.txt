Weweb developer Needed for Basic Service Website
Posted 4 days ago
Worldwide
We are looking for a skilled Weweb developer to create a basic service website that effectively represents our brand. The ideal candidate will have experience in designing visually appealing websites and a solid understanding of Webflow's capabilities. Your role will involve creating responsive layouts, integrating necessary features, and ensuring the site is user-friendly. If you have a keen eye for design and can deliver high-quality work within deadlines, we would love to hear from you!

The above AI description is perfectly right but I will add:
- the design of the landing page will be provided (designed on Figma), other pages should stick to that desgign (font, color...) but they are not specifically design, although I made some wireframe that roughly shows the layout.
Of course all design is responsive
- The website is composed of:
        - the landing page which includes some parallax/ dynamic effects
        - a few pages with text only
        - Contact page with the possibilty to send an email
        -  A user account registration process with payment at the end (multi-step form)
        -  A stripe integration
        - A calendar integration (calendly like)
